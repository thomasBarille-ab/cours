## Launch this agent

By double clicking on the BAT file, a script will be launched on your computer.
This script simply create a folder at the "Remote root directory" location set in the "new agent" form and start the agent.

## Important

- keep the console opened as long as you want the agent to be started
- keep the agent.jar at the same location as the BAT file
- a JDK must be defined in your environment variables
